# 🌐 LifeConnect

**Decentralized, AI-Powered Organ Donation Matching & Transparency Platform**  
_"Every second counts. Every match saves lives."_

---

## 🚨 Problem

India faces a critical organ donation gap — outdated matching systems, zero transparency, logistics failures, and lack of public incentives. LifeConnect addresses this with a unified AI + Blockchain infrastructure.

---

## 💡 Solution

LifeConnect combines AI, Blockchain, and Geospatial logistics to ensure secure, transparent, and intelligent organ donation and transplant coordination.

## ⚙ Key Features

- 🔗 **Blockchain Consent & Tracking** – Immutable records of donor consent, health status, and organ custody (Ethereum + IPFS).
- 🧠 **AI Matching Engine** – Uses Gemini API to match based on viability, proximity, survival prediction, etc.
- 📦 **Smart Logistics Routing** – Fastest delivery planning via Mapbox + OR-Tools.
- 📊 **Dynamic HealthCards** – Auto-updated organ eligibility with blockchain verification.
- 🎁 **LifeToken Incentives** – Rewards for donors and families (health, insurance, tax perks).
- 🏥 **Stakeholder Dashboards** – Hospitals, regulators, and families get live updates.

## ⚙️ Environment Configuration

Before proceeding with the setup, you need to configure the environment variables for the application.

1.  **Create an environment file:**
    Copy the example environment file `.env.example` to a new file named `.env` in the project root directory:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **Update environment variables:**
    Open the `.env` file and review each variable. Update the values to match your local setup or deployment environment. This typically includes:
    *   `SECRET_KEY` for JWT
    *   `DATABASE_URL` for MongoDB connection
    *   `FASTAPI_BACKEND_PORT` for the backend server
    *   URLs for external services like AI Engine, Logistics Engine, Blockchain RPC, and IPFS.

3.  **Important Security Note:**
    The `.env` file contains sensitive information and **should not be committed to version control**. Ensure that `.env` is listed in your `.gitignore` file.
